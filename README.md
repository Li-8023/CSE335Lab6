# CSE335Lab6
+During this lab, you will develop a simple table view application that represents a list of cities
you have visited.
Each city should have the following information:
a) Name of the city
b) Picture of a city
c) A Small description of the city.
+Table row should have (a) and (b) above.
+Once user selects a place, app should go to the detail view. The detail view should show the name
of the place selected, a picture of the place, and a small description (one sentence is sufficient).
+Your application should have the option to select a picture from the photo library for each city (you
can use default pictures in the photo library for this lab).
+You should be able to add and delete cities in your App. Your table can be empty during the first
invocation of the app. Then, use the add functionality to add records.
